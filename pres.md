The main part is divided into five sections. The first part introduces the development of modern architecture, and the remaining four parts each introduce a modern architect. I will now proceed with the first part of the presentation.



第一部分主要介绍了现代建筑的发展历程以及一些核心的理念。

The first part mainly introduces the development of modern architecture and some core concepts.



现代建筑主义的发展主要经历了三个时段。第一个时间点上世纪九十年代，这是现代建筑主义才刚刚萌芽。

The development of modern architecturalism has gone through three main periods. The first point in time was the 1990s, which is when modern architecturalism was just budding.



主要是由于第二次世界大战对建筑物的破坏，让人们意识到传统的美学无法满足人们的需求。人们越来越追求建筑的实用性和功能性。

It was mainly due to the destruction of buildings in World War II that people realized that traditional aesthetics（eisseitikes） could not meet the needs of people. People are increasingly seeking practicality and functionality in architecture.



第二个时间点是二十世纪二十年代，这时现代建筑主义思想逐渐成熟。

The second point in time was the 1920s, when the idea of modern architecturalism was maturing.



1919年，德国建筑师格罗皮乌斯成为包豪斯的校长。

In 1919, the German architect Gropius became the rector of the Bauhaus.



包豪斯的成立标志着现代设计教育的诞生，对世界现代设计的发展产生了深远的影响，包豪斯也是世界上第一所完全为发展现代设计教育而建立的学院。

The founding of the Bauhaus marked the birth of modern design education and had a profound impact on the development of modern design in the world. The Bauhaus was also the first institute in the world to be established solely for the development of modern design education.



第三个重要的时间节点在上世纪五十年代。现代建筑主义流行于全世界。

The third important point in time was in the 1950s. Modern architecturalism was popular all over the world.



同时，国际现代建筑协会成立也将现代建筑主义推向了高潮。

At the same time, the founding of the International Association of Modern Architecture also brought modern architecturalism to the forefront.



我要介绍的第二个部分就是关于它的一些核心理念。

The second part I want to introduce is about some of its core concepts.
